/**
 * MPQ encryption processor.
 * <p>
 * MPQ files use a hybrid stream and block based encryption algorithm. The
 * blocks are exclusive-ored with the input data to produce encrypted data.
 * Blocks are generated from the key and a seed. The seed is modified by the
 * normal data. Any remaining data that cannot fit inside a block at the end is
 * left unchanged.
 * <p>
 * The encryption is not secure and suffers from a similar weakness to that of
 * the Enigma code. If one knows 4 aligned bytes of a file, eg the starting 4
 * character, then one can brute force the key by trying all keys until one is
 * found that works. As keys are only 32 bits (4 bytes) long this process will
 * take at most a few minutes on a modern PC. It is likely this algorithm was
 * created more to obfuscate data rather than protect it and as such should
 * never be used for any security critical application.
